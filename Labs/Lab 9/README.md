We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

I would use Heroku for our website. It seems to be the best option monetarily. We wouldn't need to pay for a domain name, and to serve it is free as well. I am willing to take the trade off of having "Heroku" in the name of the link, and it not being up all the time. However if I was to deploy a portfolio website I would probably still stick with Heroku. Depending if my website is static or not I would start with the free version and possibly upgrade to the $7/month version if needed. The main reason I chose Heroku is because of the free domain.
